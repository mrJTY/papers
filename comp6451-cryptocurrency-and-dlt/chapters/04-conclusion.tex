\section{Conclusion and final remarks}

In a saturated market of cryptocurrencies with calls to "hodl to the moon", it's easy to get lost in the hype. Hashgraph stands out in a number of ways. Its algorithm offers efficiency that can enable DLTs to scale. Its governance structure can enable mainstream enterprise adoption with a path towards decentralisation. It is rare to find a simple yet solid math proof behind a cryptocurrency, let alone a formal verification by a Coq system that proves it is aBFT - the strongest security in a distributed system.

It's not so often that a technology can be disruptive and make a generational leap. Bitcoin and Ethereum may have paved the way for first and second generation DLTs, Hedera Hashgraph has the potential to take the lead on the third generation.
