\section{Current state and analysis}

\subsection{Governance}
% Governance
Originally a paper wirtten under Swirlds, ownership of Hasgraph was transferred to Hedera as the governing body. \cite{baird2018hedera} It is now goverened by a decentralised council of term-limited multinational companies. 

While it is not yet a fully decentralised network with permissionless nodes, Hedera is on it's path towards decentralisation.

As of March 2021, it is still on it's path towards decntralisation, but it has been steadily adding more permissioned nodes such as eftpos and Standard Bank \cite{gentile2021hedera}.

\subsection{Development environment}
% Code
The code will only be available as open review for release 1.0. There are no plans to open-source it as part of its governance plan. This will prevent forks from happening and Hedera is the only authorised user of the properiatery technology.

\subsection{Analysis of the algorithm}
% Analysis of the algorithm
Gossip relies on assumptions to be fully robust \cite{alvisi}. As long as <these> assumptions are met, blah blah.

\subsection{Security and tokenomics}
% Analysis on security
Hashgraph's proof-of-stake system relies on no 1/3 of the coins are owned by malicious actors. Compare this with a proof-of-work system used by Bitcoin where it assigns a leader to append blocks to the chain with the process of mining. A proof-of-stake is more environmentally friendly as no mining is invovled. It can also be argued to be fairer because it does not favour entities with economies of scale. Hashgraph also has a coin release schedule to prevent whales to dominate the market in its early days.% \cite{coin-schedule}

\subsection{Use cases}
Everyware is being used to track the supply chain of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Blockchain 3.0 discusses further usecases such as election, supply chain management, .

Throughput can enable more usecase that are not yet explored. Early days of the internet.
