\section{Background}

The rise of Bitoin as the first viable decentralised digital currency paved the way for a number of rising cryptocurrencies. Second generation distributed ledger technology (DLT) such as Ethereum enabled the development of decentralised applications with the use of smart contracts.

While these early generation DLTs have proven to be popular, scaling them have been a challenge. These cannot compete against incumbent payment systems in terms of raw transactions per second (TPS) which can limit their adoption. When a proof-of-work is used to achieve consensus, the rate of which blocks can be added were intentionally made slow so that a leader can decide consensus.

Gossip protocols are known to be the most efficient way to dessimate information.<CITE> To achieve consensus, votes were historically sent in addition to the gossip. This however is an expensive operation that grows exponentially with the number of nodes.

Hashgraph improves on this concept by using a gossip protocol to efficiently transmit events with the concept of virtual voting. Hashgraph has proven that it can reach consensus without having to send out votes across the network. This results in efficiency that can surpass TPS not only of blockhain systems but of incumbent payment systems.
