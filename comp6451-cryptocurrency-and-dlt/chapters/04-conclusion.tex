\section{Conclusion and final remarks}

In a saturated market of cryptocurrencies with calls to "hodl to the moon", it's easy to get lost in the hype. Hashgraph stands out in a number of ways. Its technical innovation offers efficiency that can enable DLTs to scale. Its governance structure can enable mainstream enterprise adoption with a path towards decentralisation. It is rare to find a cryptocurrency with these features, let alone a formal verification by a Coq system that proves it is aBFT - the strongest level of security in a distributed system.

It's not so often that a technology can be disruptive and make a generational leap. Bitcoin and Ethereum may have paved the way for first and second generation DLTs, Hedera Hashgraph has the potential to take the lead of the third generation DLTs. Similar to the early days of the internet, Hashgraph's technical capabilities and governance model may become a potential enabler for use cases in the future.
