\section{Current state and analysis}

% Governance
Originally a paper wirtten under Swirlds, ownership of Hasgraph was transferred to Hedera. It is now goverened by a decentralised council of term-limited multinational companies.


% Analysis of the algorithm
Gossip relies on assumptions to be fully robust \cite{alvisi}.

% Analysis on security
In a proof of stake system used by Hashgraph, it's security relies on no more than 1/3 of the coins are owned by malicious actors. As demand for the coins rise, it will be harder to corner a market because price will increase with a limited supply.

Compare this with a proof-of-work system used by Bitcoin where it assigns a leader to append blocks to the chain with the process of mining. A proof-of-stake is more environmentally friendly as no mining is done, 1 coin = 1 vote. It can also be argued to be fairer because it does not favour entities with economies of scale.
