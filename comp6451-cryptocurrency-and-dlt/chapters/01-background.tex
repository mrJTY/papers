\section{Background}

The rise of Bitoin as the first viable decentralised ledger technology (DLT) and digital currency paved the way for a number of rising cryptocurrencies. While these early generation DLTs have garnered world wide attention, scaling them have been a challenge for practical use. 

% When a proof-of-work is used to achieve consensus, the rate of which blocks can be added were intentionally made slow so that a leader can decide consensus.

Gossip protocols are known to efficiently broadcast information with high reliability and throughput \cite{birman}. Achieving consensus was historically done by sending votes across the network \cite{berman1989towards}. This is an expensive operation that have not been reliably implemented in real-world conditions.

Hedera Hashgraph\cite{baird2016} combines a gossip protocol with the concept of virtual voting to efficiently reach consesus. Proven to be asynchonous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) system, this results in a fast, high throughput, fair ordering, and secure system.
