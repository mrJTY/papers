% Code
The code will only be available as open review for release 1.0.

% Analysis of the algorithm
Gossip relies on assumptions to be fully robust \cite{alvisi}.

% Analysis on security

Compare this with a proof-of-work system used by Bitcoin where it assigns a leader to append blocks to the chain with the process of mining. A proof-of-stake is more environmentally friendly as no mining is done, 1 coin = 1 vote. It can also be argued to be fairer because it does not favour entities with economies of scale.
