\section{Background}

The rise of Bitoin as the first viable decentralised digital currency paved the way for a number of rising cryptocurrencies. While these early generation DLTs have proven to be popular, scaling them have been a challenge. 

% When a proof-of-work is used to achieve consensus, the rate of which blocks can be added were intentionally made slow so that a leader can decide consensus.

Gossip protocols can efficiently broadcast information with high reliability and throughput \cite{birman}. Achieving consensus however was historically done with sending expensive votes across the network \cite{berman1989towards}.

Hedera Hashgraph\cite{baird2016} combines a gossip protocol with the concept of virtual voting to efficiently reach consesus. This results in a high throughput, fairly time ordered, and asynchonous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) system.
