\section{Conclusion and final remarks}

In a saturated market of cryptocurrencies with calls such as "hodl to the moon", it's easy to get caught up in the hype. Hashgraph stands out in a number of ways. Its algorithm offers efficiency that can enable DLTs to scale while also being proven to be aBFT. Its governance structure can enable maintream enterprise adoption with a path towards decentralisation.

It's not so often that a technology can be disruptive and make a generational leap. Bitcoin and Ethereum may have paved the way for 1st and 2nd generation DLTs, Hedera Hashgraph has the potential to take the lead on the 3rd generation.
