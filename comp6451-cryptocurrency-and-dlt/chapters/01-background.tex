\section{Background}

Bitcoin \cite{nakamoto2008peer} paved the way for cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technologies (DLT) using the blockchain. While blockchain rose in popularity, wide-spread adoption has been limited due to its ability to scale. 

% When a proof-of-work is used to achieve consensus, the rate of which blocks can be added were intentionally made slow so that a leader can decide consensus.

Gossip protocols are known to efficiently broadcast information with high reliability and throughput \cite{birman}. Achieving consensus was historically done by sending votes across the network \cite{berman1989towards}. This is an expensive operation that have not been reliably implemented in real-world conditions.

Hedera Hashgraph\cite{baird2016} combines gossip protocol with the concept of virtual voting for a network to efficiently reach consensus. As a result, it provides a fast, high-throughput, fair-ordering, and asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) system alternative.
