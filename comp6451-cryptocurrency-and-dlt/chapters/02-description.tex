Hashgraph uses standard cryptographic hashes and digital signatures to securely spread events across a network (Figure \ref{fig:hashgraph}). Each member will eventually have a consistent local copy of a Hashgraph to run virtual voting the need to send votes across the network\cite{baird2016}.

The Byzantine Generals Problem\cite{shostak1982byzantine} provides the motivation to solve the consensus problem. A group of generals need consensus on their battle plans(Figure \ref{fig:byzantine}). The theorem states that consensus cannot be reached if 1/3 or more are malicious - this is the best any distributed system can do with security.

To be Byzantine Fault Tolerant means that a distributed system can withstand failure with some unreliable actors. Asynchronous adds another layer of complexity where messages may get delayed or altered, similar to the real internet with firewalls and DDoS attacks. Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) is the highest level of security a distributed system can achieve\cite{coq2018}.

Hashgraph was proven to be aBFT. A full mathematical proof is beyond the scope of this paper, but Figure \ref{fig:cheating} illustrates it's key pillar of the Strongly Seeing Lemma.

Hashgraph is currently on a path towards decentralisation that will use a proof-of-stake system. Similar to the generals problem, the network's security will rely on no more than 1/3 of the coins are owned by malicious actors. 

%As demand rises for a limited supply of coins, it will be extremely difficult for a single actor to.
% To prove how it works, let us define what strongly seeing an event means.

% The Strongly Seeing Theorem <CITE> is the key pillar of how hashgraph works. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose Mallory wants to cheat the system by forking an event. (This is a condensed summary of the proof, see the whitepaper for the full proof) Alice's local hashgraph reads 2n/3 x strongly sees w and another 2n/3 strongly sees y, then the intersection must be >1/3. The assumption is no more than 1/3 is dishonest so there must be an honest member in between. However, that honest member cannot strongly see both events because x and y are fork and breaks the definition of strongly seeing. This is a contradiction therefore the assumption that x strongly sees w is false. Mallory will not be able to cheat if no more than 1/3 of the nodes are malicious.
