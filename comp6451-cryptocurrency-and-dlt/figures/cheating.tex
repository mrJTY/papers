    \caption{
        Suppose Mallory can cheat by forking an event, eg:
        she could double spend her coins by gossiping two different events (x \& y) to different members. The Strongly Seeing Lemma states that a forked event will not be strongly seen by other members. A proof by contradiction shows that if 2/3 strongly sees x and 2/3 also strongly sees y, then this is impossible to be strongly seen if only less than 1/3 are malicious. If Alice, Bob, and Carol are honest and communicate further, they will agree not to strongly see Mallory's events as valid.
